# Deploy-a-High-Availability-Application

## DevOps Skills Practiced: Infrastructure as code, architecture, and databases .
The challenge here is to build an app that the user can access even when it crashes. Building an app with high availability will require a backend database. If you use WordPress, you will need to implement high availability through positioning the second instance of WordPress when the first one encounters a problem. In addition, you have to add components like reverse proxy or a load balancer, which you can use to distribute requests between the live instances.
